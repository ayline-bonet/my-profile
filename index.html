			 Hello and welcome to my profile! Please take a moment to discover who I am, and enjoy!

			 <h2>Who am I?</h2>
			 <p>My name is Ayline, I am a 18 year-old French girl studying at ESSEC Singapore, to become the greatest business woman 🫡.I have a lot of hobbies and interests that you will discover below. But I also love hanging out with my friends, watching movies and series and listening to music.</p>

				<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>I absolutely love watching sports on the TV, or in live events. I am found of football (or soccer if you’re American🦅🔥🇺🇲), Formula 1, rugby and tennis. I simply love the hype around each sport which absolutely changes your experience. My favourite football team is PSG, and my fav F1 team is Ferrari. It is quite something to support unlucky teams 😎. And don’t ask me about practising sports, it’s another story. Even though I used to practise dancing for a long time, I got too lazy and busy to try other activities.</p>

				<h2>Animes</h2>
				<p>Anime is one of my biggest hobbies as well. I have many favourite shows but my top 3 is JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Attack on Titan and Naruto. I have been watching animes for quite some time already, and I am glad it got more popular so I got more people to talk about it with. I therefore have a great interest for Japan, where I had the chance to travel to recently. </p>

				<h2>Video games</h2>
				<p>I also enjoy playing video games in my free time (I am still far from being a pro gamer🤓). I especially play Genshin Impact. I recently got into Fortnite and Brawl Stars (honourable mention for Hayday👩‍🌾), as everyone around me is playing actively.</p>
